# To maximize my income considering limited time, I will opt to drive at a location and time with high demand. This is to ensure that occupancy of my taxi is almost guaranteed for the time I drive.

# With a limited 10 hours per week, my goal with be to work when the demand for taxia is high. This is so that there will be no extended periods with a passenger in the taxi. From the analysis above, it can be seen that Thurdays and Fridays are the days with the most demand. Demand for taxis are highest between 5pm and 10pm and the location

# ## If you could enrich the dataset, what would you add? Is there anything in the dataset that you donâ€™t find especially useful?

# Attempts at enriching the dataset can include:
#     - Identifying and removing outliers as necessary
#     - Checking for and handling missing values
#     - Find other data sources with data such such as longitide and latitude for pickup and dropoff zones to allow more pinpoint description.
#     - Differentiate FHV rides YT rides
#         
# I find all variables in the data set to be useful in someway, although not all were useful for this task. For example, tip amount and payment type. However, a closer look at tip amount can tell what time of the day passengers tend to tip more. Is it during commutes to work or during happy hours after relaxing with friends?
